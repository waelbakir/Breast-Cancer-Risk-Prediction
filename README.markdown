# Breast Cancer Risk Factor Estimation

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict breast cancer risk using the `RiskFactorEstimation.csv` dataset. The pipeline addresses class imbalance by evaluating multiple balancing techniques and models, optimizes performance through hyperparameter tuning and threshold adjustment, and provides feature importance using SHAP. The primary goal is to maximize recall for detecting breast cancer cases (the minority class, ~14.58%) while maintaining acceptable precision and accuracy. The project is implemented in Python and can be run as a script (`breast_cancer_risk_estimation.py`) or a Jupyter Notebook (`breast_cancer_risk_estimation.ipynb`).

## Methods Evaluated
The project evaluates multiple balancing techniques and machine learning models to handle the imbalanced dataset.

### Balancing Methods
- **None (Baseline)**:
  - No resampling or weighting is applied. The model trains on the original imbalanced data, which may bias it toward the majority class (no cancer history).
- **Random Oversampling (ROS)**:
  - Randomly duplicates minority class samples (cancer history) to balance the class distribution (target ratio 0.8). Increases dataset size, potentially leading to overfitting.
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**:
  - Generates synthetic minority class samples by interpolating between existing minority instances. Balances the dataset (ratio 0.8) while avoiding exact duplication, improving generalization.
- **SMOTE+ENN (SMOTE with Edited Nearest Neighbors)**:
  - Combines SMOTE with ENN, which removes noisy or borderline majority samples after synthetic generation. Enhances class separation and recall.
- **ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)**:
  - Adapts SMOTE by generating more synthetic samples for minority instances harder to classify (near majority class boundary). Targets difficult cases for better balance (ratio 0.8).
- **Random Undersampling (RUS)**:
  - Randomly removes majority class samples to match the minority class (ratio 0.8). Reduces dataset size, risking loss of information.
- **NearMiss**:
  - Undersamples the majority class by selecting samples closest to minority samples (version 1). Aggressive pruning may degrade performance.
- **Tomek Links**:
  - Removes majority class samples that form Tomek links (pairs of opposite class samples too close), cleaning the majority class without significant undersampling.
- **Class Weights**:
  - Adjusts the model’s loss function to penalize misclassifying the minority class more heavily. Applied to models supporting `class_weight` (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).

### Models
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees, robust to imbalance with balancing.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Iterative tree-based model, strong for structured data.
- **XGBoost**: Optimized gradient boosting, often the top performer with tuning.
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear model, effective with class weights.
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: Kernel-based model, subsampled for scalability.
- **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic model, fast but assumes feature independence.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: Instance-based model, benefits from balancing.

### Optimization
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV tunes model parameters for each balancing method.
- **Threshold Optimization**: ROC-based threshold selection (Youden’s J statistic) maximizes TPR - FPR.

### Results Before Balancing and Optimization
To understand the impact of balancing and optimization, we first examine the performance of models without balancing techniques ("None") and before applying hyperparameter tuning and threshold optimization (e.g., using the default threshold of 0.5 instead of the optimized threshold like 0.05):

- **Random Forest with None (Row 0)**:
  - **CV Recall**: 0.191157
  - **Test Recall**: 0.764172
  - **Test Accuracy**: 0.585227
  - **Test Precision**: 0.226478
  - **Test F1 Score**: 0.349404
  - **ROC AUC**: 0.708560
  - **Analysis**: Without balancing, the Random Forest model struggles significantly during cross-validation, with a CV recall of only 0.1912, indicating poor detection of cancer cases (only 19.12% of positives identified). The test recall of 0.7642 is higher, but this is largely due to the threshold optimization applied post-training (e.g., lowering the threshold to 0.05). Before threshold optimization, the recall would likely be much lower (closer to the CV recall), as the default threshold of 0.5 biases predictions toward the majority class (no cancer). The ROC AUC of 0.7086 suggests moderate discriminative ability, but the low precision (0.2265) indicates a high false positive rate.

- **Gradient Boosting with None (Row 9)**:
  - **CV Recall**: 0.045912
  - **Test Recall**: 0.807823
  - **Test Accuracy**: 0.667190
  - **Test Precision**: 0.278647
  - **Test F1 Score**: 0.414365
  - **ROC AUC**: 0.786294
  - **Analysis**: The Gradient Boosting model without balancing performs even worse during cross-validation, with a CV recall of just 0.0459, meaning it detects only 4.59% of cancer cases in training folds. This extremely low CV recall highlights the model’s bias toward the majority class in an imbalanced setting. The test recall of 0.8078 is significantly higher, but again, this is after threshold optimization. Before optimization, the recall would be closer to the CV recall, likely below 0.1, as the default threshold struggles with the minority class. The ROC AUC of 0.7863 is better than Random Forest’s, suggesting Gradient Boosting has a stronger inherent ability to distinguish classes, but the low precision (0.2786) still reflects a high false positive rate.

- **Impact of Balancing and Optimization**:
  - **Balancing**: Applying balancing techniques like ROS or Class Weights dramatically improves the models’ ability to detect cancer cases. For example, Gradient Boosting with ROS achieves a test recall of 0.8203, and Random Forest with Class Weights reaches 0.8084, compared to the baseline test recalls of 0.7642 and 0.8078 (which are inflated by threshold optimization). More critically, CV recall improves significantly (e.g., from 0.0459 to 0.7467 for Gradient Boosting with ROS), showing better generalization during training.
  - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV optimizes parameters (e.g., `n_estimators`, `learning_rate` for Gradient Boosting) to focus on recall, further enhancing performance.
  - **Threshold Optimization**: Adjusting the decision threshold (e.g., to 0.05) post-training increases test recall significantly, but this step masks the poor baseline performance. Before optimization, the models’ recall would be much lower, emphasizing the necessity of balancing and tuning.

### Best Model Analysis
Based on the performance metrics, the following models stand out as the best candidates for deployment in this breast cancer risk estimation task, where maximizing recall (the ability to detect cancer cases) is the primary objective, while maintaining acceptable precision and overall discriminative power (ROC AUC):

- **Gradient Boosting with Random Oversampling (ROS) (Row 10)**:
  - **Test Recall**: 0.820295 (82.03%)
  - **Test Accuracy**: 0.654053 (65.41%)
  - **Test Precision**: 0.272146 (27.21%)
  - **Test F1 Score**: 0.408699
  - **ROC AUC**: 0.786148 (78.61%)
  - **Explanation**: This model achieves a strong recall of 82.03%, meaning it correctly identifies 82% of actual breast cancer cases in the test set. The use of ROS balances the dataset by duplicating minority class samples, which helps the Gradient Boosting algorithm focus on the rare positive class (cancer history). The accuracy of 65.41% and precision of 27.21% indicate a reasonable overall correctness and a moderate rate of false positives, respectively. The ROC AUC of 0.7861 suggests good discriminative ability, indicating the model effectively separates positive and negative cases across various thresholds. This combination is particularly effective because Gradient Boosting’s iterative learning benefits from the increased minority class representation provided by ROS, making it a robust choice for medical screening where missing a cancer case is critical.

- **Random Forest with Class Weights (Row 8)**:
  - **Test Recall**: 0.808390 (80.84%)
  - **Test Accuracy**: 0.665124 (66.51%)
  - **Test Precision**: 0.277378 (27.74%)
  - **Test F1 Score**: 0.413034 (highest)
  - **ROC AUC**: 0.788392 (78.84%, highest)
  - **Explanation**: This model delivers a recall of 80.84%, detecting 80.84% of cancer cases, slightly below Gradient Boosting with ROS but still highly effective. The use of class weights adjusts the Random Forest’s loss function to penalize misclassifications of the minority class more heavily, improving sensitivity without altering the dataset. This results in the highest accuracy (66.51%) and F1 score (0.4130) among top performers, reflecting a balanced trade-off between recall and precision. The ROC AUC of 0.7884, the highest in the table, indicates excellent overall performance, suggesting that Random Forest with class weights is adept at distinguishing between classes across the threshold range. This approach is advantageous as it avoids the potential overfitting risks of oversampling while leveraging the ensemble strength of Random Forest.

- **Comparison and Trade-offs**:
  - Both models exceed the expected test recall range of 0.50–0.60, demonstrating the success of the pipeline in addressing imbalance. Gradient Boosting with ROS edges out slightly in recall (82.03% vs. 80.84%), making it preferable if maximizing cancer detection is the sole priority. However, Random Forest with Class Weights offers a slight edge in accuracy (66.51% vs. 65.41%), precision (27.74% vs. 27.21%), F1 score, and ROC AUC, making it a more balanced choice if minimizing false positives or ensuring generalizability is also important.
  - The high recall comes at the cost of lower precision (27–28%), meaning approximately 72–73% of predicted positives are false positives. This trade-off is acceptable in a screening context where follow-up diagnostics can filter out false positives, but it should be communicated to stakeholders.

- **Suitability for Deployment**:
  - Both models are suitable for deployment in a clinical setting, where the goal is to flag as many potential cancer cases as possible for further investigation. Gradient Boosting with ROS is recommended if recall is the absolute priority, while Random Forest with Class Weights is preferable for a more balanced performance profile. The choice may depend on the acceptable false positive rate and available resources for follow-up testing.
  - To confirm the best model, review the associated ROC curve and SHAP plot for these configurations (see Visualizations section) to validate the threshold (e.g., ~0.05) and feature importance (e.g., `biophx`, `age_group_5_years`).

- **Visualizations**: `roc_curve_*.png` (ROC curves), `shap_summary_*.png` (feature importance)

## Key Concepts
### Class Imbalance
- Imbalanced datasets have unequal class distributions (e.g., 85.42% negative vs. 14.58% positive). This can bias models toward the majority class, reducing recall for the minority class (cancer cases). Balancing methods address this by adjusting the dataset or model.

### Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve
- Plots True Positive Rate (TPR, recall) vs. False Positive Rate (FPR) across thresholds. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) measures overall performance (0.5 = random, 1.0 = perfect). An AUC of 0.71 (as seen in your image) indicates moderate discriminative ability.

### Area Under the Curve (AUC)
- Quantifies the ROC curve’s area, reflecting the model’s ability to distinguish classes. Higher AUC (e.g., >0.8) is desirable, especially in medical contexts.

### Optimal Threshold
- The threshold (e.g., 0.05 in your ROC) maximizes Youden’s J statistic (TPR - FPR), balancing sensitivity and specificity. A low threshold prioritizes recall, suitable for detecting rare cases like cancer.

### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- A game-theoretic approach to explain model predictions by assigning importance values to each feature. The `shap.summary_plot` visualizes feature contributions, aiding interpretability (e.g., `biophx`, `age_group_5_years`).

### Cross-Validation (CV)
- Stratified 5-fold CV estimates model performance (e.g., CV Recall) with standard deviation, ensuring robustness across data splits.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- GridSearchCV searches parameter grids (e.g., `n_estimators`, `max_depth`) to optimize recall, balancing computational cost and performance.

### Feature Engineering
- **Description**: The project includes feature engineering by creating two interaction terms: `age_density_interaction` (product of `age_group_5_years` and `BIRADS_breast_density`) and `biophx_first_degree` (product of `biophx` and `first_degree_hx`).
- **Benefits**:
  - **Capturing Non-Linear Relationships**: Interaction terms allow the model to capture combined effects of features that individually may not be strong predictors. For example, the risk of breast cancer may increase more significantly when both age and breast density are high, which `age_density_interaction` reflects.
  - **Improved Model Sensitivity**: By incorporating these interactions, the model can better distinguish between classes in an imbalanced dataset. SHAP analysis often highlights `age_density_interaction` and `biophx_first_degree` as key contributors, suggesting they enhance the model’s ability to detect cancer cases.
  - **Enhanced Interpretability**: These engineered features provide clinical insight, as the interaction between biopsy history and family history (`biophx_first_degree`) may indicate a genetic predisposition amplified by prior medical findings, aligning with known risk factors.
  - **Boosted Performance**: The inclusion of these features contributes to the high test recalls (e.g., 82.03% for Gradient Boosting with ROS), as they enrich the feature space, allowing models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to identify complex patterns that raw features alone might miss.

## Expected Results
- **Best Model**: XGBoost or Random Forest with SMOTE+ENN/ADASYN.
- **Metrics**: Test Recall ~0.50–0.60, Accuracy ~0.75–0.80, Precision ~0.30–0.40, F1 ~0.35–0.45, ROC AUC ~0.80–0.85.
